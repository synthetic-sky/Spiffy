Spiffy
======

Welcome to Spiffy App.

This browser-based app is really a visual interface to a (partially working) A.I.,
 called Synth, which you will clone right along with Spiffy. Right?

To set up everything, make sure you have at least the following:

	- gcc or clang
	- Python (preferably 2.7)
	- Node.js 
	- wget or curl

If you do, run 

	$ git clone https://github.com/synthetic-sky/Spiffy
	$ cd Spiffy
	$ ./make.py

That will download and compile all pre-requisites, including Synth.

Once done, simply run

	$ ./spiffy.py

This will start a node server, and a Synth backend.

Now simply navigate to http://localhost:2007

And you are done.
